## All Notes
For the best output people must have:
- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

Autonomous squad is 7+/-2 people

Org needs to provide Squad Health Check model

When teams need to collaborate, we form a Tribe = Sense of team as a team of teams
-> <150 people for social interactions to work

We operate under "Servant Leadership" ([Team of teams book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/0241250838)
-> leader here to serve and support the team

Team communication defaults to Open.

Team monitors all important metrics.

Failure Recovery > Failure Avoidance:
- We celebrate Failure
- Limited Blast Radius: only the minimum is impacted by a failure, even Frontend: one part blows up only
- Rolling Updates: applications update are rolled out gradually and automatically rolled back if issues (implies automatic health checks)

Minimum Viable Agility:
- Daily Stand-Up
- Regular Retros
- Frequent Planning
- Code Reviews
- Visual Board (of issues/work to do)
- Continuous Integration

=> It is the minimum framework the enterprise asks teams to follow

Alignment = Intent + Rationale + Constraint + Communication
Example: "Cross rivers" +  "More food on other side" + "Don't kill the other" + "Agree on bridge or tunnel"

Company Beliefs = Top Level Rationale
  |__ North Star + 2 year goal
    |__ Company Bet: We put them in Kanban board (limit of 10 comapny bets)
        -> only what cannot be pushed down to teams / tribes
        
Individual Accountability  + Collective Responsibility

Tribe OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

Competence = Shared Work Beliefs + Technical Excellence
  -> if not: I cannot trust you, let you be autonomous
  
Guilds pushing for excellence and consistency for a given craft (frontend, testing, embedded) => every year whole guild meets for a week
