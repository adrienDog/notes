|WeChat Founder Product Principles - Allen Zhang | product | https://a16z.com/2019/02/05/allen-zhang-wechat-product-principles/ | - 1: The Golden Principle: The user is your friend <br> - 2: Technology is for efficiency <br> - 3: KPIs are secondary (“data informed” versus a “data driven” approach, The best products, in Zhang’s opinion, not only have organic adoption but also require no explanation) <br> - 4: Decentralized ecosystem (“Our job is more to let the good services emerge, which is showing respect towards our users”) ||

There is very real value in things like refactoring, restructuring, tooling, better customer research, more instrumentation, debt workdown, inviting customers into the design process, etc. It literally could be the MOST IMPORTANT thing you might be able to work on. This is why arbitrary % allocations or side-projects, or. “1 item per sprint” guidelines sort of miss the mark.* <br> - *Transparency is key, and transparency requires psychological safety and a deep desire to work across boundaries and silos.
