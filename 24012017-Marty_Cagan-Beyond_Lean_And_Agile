# Beyond Lean and Agile
## Theme 1 - Address major risks upfront
###Â Value risk
- Touches **demand**: Usually not that hard to determine
- What is hard: is team's solution good enough that it causes people to switch! It has to be demonstrably better (10x)
- In some companies, this is skipped: roadmap is a symptom of assumed value
- Value is where our time needs to be spent
@pm @ceo

### Usability risk
- B2B usually fail at that and it does make a difference
@designers

### Feasibility risk
- Do we have the skillset?
- Do we know how to do this?
- Do we have the technology?
- "Until they figure out how to solve that problem, they dont have a problem" For some products it is a huge area (rockets) some others less (Open Table)
- If done wrong: something is carried along for many sprints
@engineers

### Business risk
- Difference between a successful product person and most
- Can we do it in a way that's legal? That is okay with our contracts? Do we have a risk of going bankrupt?
- Do we have a channel to sale this product?
- Do we have the sales skills to sale that product?
- Huge part of the product job
@pm @ceo

[Aparte 1] Being a PM is really hard! You have to tackle all these risks
- the PM really is the CEO of the product (NOT the boss of everybody, but they have to see all these elements)
- not only an analytics job or scrum job

=> **All great companies tackle these before building anything! == purpose of an MVP**
